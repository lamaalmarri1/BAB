This is a simple web application that aims to allow users to search for Quran verses in English. It consists of two  pages: a mock-login page and a basic search page. Please note that the search functionality is very simple and is not fully implemented yet.

# 1. Mock Login Page
## Description:
This task involves creating a simple login page with a mock authentication system. The login form asks for a username/email and password. However, this is a static page, meaning it does not redirect or authenticate the user. It simply simulates the process of logging in.

## Features:
* Username/email input field.
* Password input field.
* Login button (currently, no real functionality, just a static design).
## Technologies Used:
* HTML for structuring the page.
* CSS for styling and layout.
* Font Awesome for icons used in the login form.
## How to Use:
* Open the login.html file in your browser.
* Enter a username and password (this is purely visual and does not trigger any actual login or redirection).
* The "Login" button does not redirect anywhere (it is just for design purposes).


# 2. Search Page
## Description:
This task creates a simple search page where the user can enter a keyword (such as a Surah name or verse number). The page displays the search results (currently static and primitive) based on the user's query.

## Features:
* A search bar where the user can type a keyword.
* A "Search" button that triggers a search (currently simulated and not connected to any real backend).
## Technologies Used:
* HTML for structuring the page.
* CSS for styling and layout.
* JavaScript for handling user input and simulating a search.
## How to Use:
* Open the home.html file in your browser.
* Type a Surah name or verse into the search bar.
* Click the "Search" button to trigger the search (results are static and primitive at the moment).

# General Notes:
* The login page is a static page and does not perform any actual login or redirection.
* The search page is a simple static version with no real search functionality at the moment.
* Note: I am a beginner in front-end development , and I have limited experience with creating dynamic web pages. Despite this, I have put my best effort into this task to make it as functional as possible.
